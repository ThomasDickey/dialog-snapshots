-- T.Dickey <dickey@clark.net>

This version of dialog was originally from a Debian snapshot.  I've done this
to it:

1999/11/27
	+ fix some gcc warnings about ambiguous use of "else"

1999/5/1

	+ cleaned up some of the redundant code with new functions:
		box_x_ordinate
		box_y_ordinate
		draw_title
		draw_bottom_box
		new_window

	+ modified msgbox.c and yesno.c to work with the KEY_RESIZE sigwinch
	  handling in ncurses 4.2

	+ corrected spelling of "gauge"
