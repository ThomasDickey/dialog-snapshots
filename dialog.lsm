Entered-date:   06MAR05
Description:    Dialog is a program that will let you present a variety
                of questions or display messages in nice looking color
                non-graphical dialog boxes from a shell or perl script.
                Various dialog boxes can be presented such as yes/no, menu,
                input, message, checklist, radiolist, and more.

                This program is based on the no longer maintained cdialog, but
                contains bug fixes and more features.
