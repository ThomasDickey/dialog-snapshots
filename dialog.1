.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBDialog\fP
is a program that will let you to present a variety of questions or
display messages using dialog boxes from a shell script.
These types of dialog boxes are implemented
(though not all are necessarily compiled into \fBdialog\fR):
.RS
.LP
.BR calendar ", "
.BR checklist ", "
.BR fselect ", "
.BR gauge ", "
.BR infobox ", "
.BR inputbox ", "
.BR menu ", "
.BR msgbox " (message), "
.BR password ", "
.BR radiolist ", "
.BR tailbox ", "
.BR tailboxbg ", "
.BR textbox ", "
.BR timebox ", and "
.BR yesno " (yes/no)."
.RE
.PP
You can put more than one dialog box into a script:
.TP 5
-
Use the \fB\-\-and-widget\fP token to force Dialog to proceed to the next
dialog unless you have pressed ESC to cancel, or
.TP 5
-
Simply add the tokens for the next dialog box, making a chain.
Dialog stops chaining when the return code from a dialog is nonzero,
e.g., Cancel or No.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fBCommon Options\fP
.
.IP "\fB\-\-aspect \fIratio"
This gives you some control over the box dimensions when using auto
sizing (specifying 0 for height and width).
It represents width / height.
The default is 9, which means 9 characters wide to every 1 line high.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-backtitle \fIbacktitle"
Specifies a
\fIbacktitle\fP
string to be displayed on the backdrop, at the top of the screen.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-beep"
Sound the audible alarm
each time the screen is refreshed.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-beep-after"
Beep if input is interrupted, e.g., by a control/C.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-begin \fIy x"
Specify the position of the upper left corner of a dialog box on the screen.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-clear"
The screen will be cleared to the
\fBscreen attribute\fP
on exit.
This may be used alone, without other options.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-cr-wrap"
Interpret embedded newlines in the dialog text as a newline on the screen.
Otherwise, \fBdialog\fR will only wrap lines where needed to fit inside the text box.
Even though you can control line breaks with this,
\fBdialog\fR will still wrap any lines that are too long for the width of the box.
Without cr-wrap, the layout of your text may be formatted to look nice
in the source code of your script without affecting the way it will
look in the dialog.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-create-rc \fIfile"
When
\fBdialog\fP
supports run-time configuration,
this can be used to dump a sample configuration file to the file specified
by
.IR file "."
.
.IP "\fB\-\-help"
Prints the help message to standard error.
The help message is printed if no options are given.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-defaultno"
Make the default value of the
\fByes/no\fP
box a
.BR No .
.
.IP "\fB\-\-default-item \fIstring"
Set the default item in a menu box.
Normally the first item in the box is the default.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-item-help"
Interpret the tags data for checklist, radiolist and menuboxes 
adding a column which is displayed in the bottom line of the
screen, for the currently selected item.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-no-kill"
Tells
\fBdialog\fP
to put the
\fBtailboxbg\fP
box in the background,
printing its process id to standard error.
SIGHUP is disabled for the background process.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-no-shadow"
Suppress shadows that would be drawn to the right and bottom of each dialog box.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-no-cancel"
.IP "\fB\-\-nocancel"
Suppress the "Cancel" button in checklist, inputbox and menubox modes.
A script can still test if the user pressed the ESC key to cancel to quit.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-print-maxsize"
Print the maximum size of dialog boxes, i.e., the screen size,
to the standard error.
This may be used alone, without other options.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-print-size"
Prints the size of each dialog box to standard error.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-print-version"
Prints \fBdialog\fR's version to standard error.
This may be used alone, without other options.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-separate-output"
For checklist widgets, output result one line at a time, with no quoting.
This facilitates parsing by another program.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-separate-widget \fIstring"
Specify a string that will separate the output on standard error from
each widget.
This is used to simplify parsing the result of a dialog with several widgets.
If this option is not given,
the default separator string is a tab character.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-shadow"
Draw a shadow to the right and bottom of each dialog box.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-size-err"
Check the resulting size of a dialog box before trying to use it,
printing the resulting size if it is larger than the screen.
(This option is obsolete, since all new-window calls are checked).
.
.IP "\fB\-\-sleep \fIsecs"
Sleep (delay) for the given number of seconds after processing a dialog box.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-stderr"
Direct output to the standard error.
This is the default, since curses normally writes screen updates to
the standard output.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-stdout"
Direct output to the standard output.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-tab-correct"
Convert each tab character to one or more spaces.
Otherwise, tabs are rendered according to the curses library's interpretation.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-tab-len \fIn"
Specify the number of spaces that a tab character occupies if the
\fB"\fB\-\-tab-correct"\fP
option is given.
The default is 8.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-title \fItitle"
Specifies a
\fItitle\fP
string to be displayed at the top of the dialog box.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-version"
Same as "\fB\-\-print-version\fP".
.
.\" ************************************************************************
.TP
\fBBox Options\fP
.RS
All dialog boxes have at least three parameters:
.TP 5
\fItext\fP
the caption or contents of the box.
.TP 5
\fIheight\fP
the height of the dialog box.
.TP 5
\fIwidth\fP
the width of the dialog box.
.PP
Other parameters depend on the box type.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-\-calendar \fItext height width day month year"
A
\fBcalendar\fP
box displays month, day and year in separately adjustable windows.
You can increment or decrement any of those using the
left-, up-, right- and down-arrows.
Use tab or backtab to move between windows.
If the year is given as zero, the current date is used as an initial value.
On exit, the date is printed in the form day/month/year.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-checklist \fItext height width list-height \fR[ \fItag item status \fR] \fI..."
A
\fBchecklist\fP
box is similar to a
\fBmenu\fP
box; there are
multiple entries presented in the form of a menu.
Instead of choosing
one entry among the entries, each entry can be turned on or off by the user.
The initial on/off state of each entry is specified by
.IR status "."
On exit, a list of the
\fItag\fP
strings of those entries that are turned on will be printed on
.IR stderr "."
.
.IP "\fB\-\-fselect \fI filepath height width\fR"
The file-selection dialog displays a text-entry window in which you can type
a filename (or directory), and above that two windows with directory
names and filenames.
.sp
Here
\fBfilepath\fP
can be a filepath in which case the file and directory windows
will display the contents of the path and the text-entry window will contain
the preselected filename.
.sp
Use tab or arrow keys to move between the windows.
Within the directory or filename windows, use the up/down arrow keys
to scroll the current selection.
Use the space-bar to copy the current selection into the text-entry
window.
.sp
Typing any printable characters switches focus to the text-entry window,
entering that character as well as scrolling the directory and filename
windows to the closest match.
.sp
Use a carriage return or the "OK" button to accept the current value
in the text-entry window, or the "Cancel" button to cancel.

.IP "\fB\-\-gauge \fItext height width [percent]\fR"
A
\fBgauge\fP
box displays a meter along the bottom of the box.
The meter indicates the percentage.
New percentages are read from
standard input, one integer per line.
The meter is updated
to reflect each new percentage.
If stdin is XXX, then subsequent
lines up to another XXX are used for a new prompt.
The gauge exits when EOF is reached on stdin.
.sp
The \fIpercent\fR value denotes the initial percentage shown in the meter.
If not specified, it is zero.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-infobox \fItext height width"
An \fBinfo\fP box is basically a \fBmessage\fP box.
However, in this case, \fBdialog\fP
will exit immediately after displaying the message to the user.
The screen is not cleared when \fBdialog\fP
exits, so that the message will remain on the screen until the calling
shell script clears it later.
This is useful when you want to inform
the user that some operations are carrying on that may require some
time to finish.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-inputbox \fItext height width [init]"
An
\fBinput\fP
box is useful when you want to ask questions that
require the user to input a string as the answer.
If init is supplied
it is used to initialize the input string.
When entering the
string, the
\fIBACKSPACE\fP
key can be used to correct typing errors.
If the input string is longer than
can fit in the dialog box, the input field will be scrolled.
On exit, the input string will be printed on
.IR stderr "."
.
.IP "\fB\-\-menu \fItext height width menu-height \fR[ \fItag item \fR] \fI..."
As its name suggests, a
\fBmenu\fP
box is a dialog box that can be used to present a list of choices in
the form of a menu for the user to choose.
Choices are displayed in the order given.
Each menu entry consists of a \fItag\fP string and an \fIitem\fP string.
The \fItag\fP
gives the entry a name to distinguish it from the other entries in the
menu.
The \fIitem\fP is a short description of the option that the entry represents.
The user can move between the menu entries by pressing the
\fIUP/DOWN\fP keys, the first letter of the \fItag\fP
as a hot-key, or the number keys
.IR 1-9 ". There are"
\fImenu-height\fP
entries displayed in the menu at one time, but the menu will be
scrolled if there are more entries than that.
When \fBdialog\fP exits, the \fItag\fP
of the chosen menu entry will be printed on
.IR stderr "."
.
.IP "\fB\-\-msgbox \fItext height width"
A \fBmessage\fP box is very similar to a \fByes/no\fP box.
The only difference between a \fBmessage\fP box and a \fByes/no\fP
box is that a \fBmessage\fP box has only a single \fBOK\fP button.
You can use this dialog box to display any message you like.
After reading the message, the user can press the \fIENTER\fP key so that
\fBdialog\fP will exit and the calling shell script can continue its operation.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-passwordbox \fItext height width [init]"
A
\fBpassword\fP
box is similar to an input box, except that the text the user
enters is not displayed.
This is useful when prompting for passwords or other
sensitive information.
Be aware that if anything is passed in "init", it
will be visible in the system's process table to casual snoopers.
Also, it
is very confusing to the user to provide them with a default password they
cannot see.
For these reasons, using "init" is highly discouraged.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-radiolist \fItext height width list-height \fR [ \fItag item status \fR] \fI..."
A
\fBradiolist\fP
box is similar to a
\fBmenu\fP
box.
The only difference is
that you can indicate which entry is currently selected, by setting its
.IR status " to " on "."
.
.IP "\fB\-\-tailbox file height width"
Display text from a file in a dialog box, as in a "tail -f" command.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-tailboxbg file height width"
Display text from a file in a dialog box as a background task,
as in a "tail -f &" command.
.IP
Dialog treats the background task specially if there are other
widgets (\fB\-\-and-widget\fP) on the screen concurrently.
Until those widgets are closed (e.g., an "OK"),
dialog will perform all of the tailboxbg widgets in the same process,
polling for updates.
You may use a tab to traverse between the widgets on the screen,
and close them individually, e.g., by pressing \fIENTER\fP.
Once the non-tailboxbg widgets are closed, dialog forks a copy of itself
into the background, and prints its process id if the \fB\-\-no-kill\fP option
is given.
.IP
NOTE:
Older versions of dialog forked immediately and attempted to
update the screen individually.
Besides being bad for performance,
it was unworkable.
Some older scripts may not work properly with the polled scheme.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-textbox file height width"
A
\fBtext\fP
box lets you display the contents of a text file in a dialog box.
It is like a simple text file viewer.
The user can move through the file by using the
.IR UP/DOWN ", " PGUP/PGDN
.RI and " HOME/END" " keys available on most keyboards."
If the lines are too long to be displayed in the box, the
\fILEFT/RIGHT\fP
keys can be used to scroll the text region horizontally.
For more convenience,
forward and backward searching functions are also provided.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-timebox \fItext height [width hour minute second]"
A dialog is displayed which allows you to select hour, minute and
second.
You can increment or decrement any of those using the
left-, up-, right- and down-arrows.
Use tab or backtab to move between windows.
On exit, the result is printed in the form hour:minute:second.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-yesno \fItext height width"
A \fByes/no\fP dialog box of
size \fIheight\fP rows by \fIwidth\fP columns will be displayed.
The string specified by
\fItext\fP
is displayed inside the dialog box.
If this string is too long to fit
in one line, it will be automatically divided into multiple lines at
appropriate places.
The
\fItext\fP
string can also contain the sub-string
.I
"\en"
or newline characters
\fI`\en\'\fP
to control line breaking explicitly.
This dialog box is useful for
asking questions that require the user to answer either yes or no.
The dialog box has a
\fBYes\fP
button and a
\fBNo\fP
button, in which the user can switch between by pressing the
.IR TAB " key."
