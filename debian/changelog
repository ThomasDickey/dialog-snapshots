dialog (0.9a-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merged old README.debian into copyright file.
  * dialog.c: dialog_input_result printed with "%s" format.
    This was Bug #9913, fixed by Bill Mitchell, but the change was lost.
  * debian/rules and Makefile: prefix includes "usr".
  * debian/rules: make OPTIM="-O2 -g -Wall".

    is made zero lenght (otherwise it would not work *without* fakeroot).
  * Compressed changelog.Debian.
