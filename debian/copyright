This is Debian/GNU Linux's prepackaged version of Savio Lam's dialog
utility.  It is now (apparently) being developed by Florian La Roche
(florian@jurix.jura.uni-sb.de).  This program enables the presentation
of a variety of questions or display messages using dialog boxes from
a shell script.

This package was first created by Leland Lucius <llucius@debian.org>.
