This version of dialog was originally from a Debian snapshot.  I've done this
to it:

2000/6/29
	+ add alternate test-script for gauge, adapted from Xdialog.
	+ modify guage to make optional a percentage which was read at the
	  beginning of the XXX-delimited message text, since clones of dialog
	  are written to assume this is text.  If the line is not a simple
	  integer, dialog will treat it as text.
	+ make the percent parameter of gauge optional, as in Xdialog.
	+ undo one use of CharOf() in guage.c, an error.
	+ fix configure macro AM_WITH_NLS to refrain from attempting to make a
	  symbolic link into/libintl.h if we are not using the bundled intl
	  directory from gettext (reported by Julian Coleman
	  <J.D.Coleman@newcastle.ac.uk>).
	+ add ru.po, from Michael Sobolev <mss@transas.com>
	+ updates for config.guess, config.sub from tin.
	+ updates for configure script macros:  CF_MATH_LIB (improperly nested
	  brackets/parenthesis) and CF_XOPEN_CURSES (make include of
	  <*curses.h> depend on configure tests).

2000/4/25
	+ repaint screen when a control/L is pressed.
	+ apply CharOf() macro to avoid sign-extension on calls to waddch(),
	  fixes a problem with accented characters (reported by Santiago Vila).
	+ add es.po, from Santiago Vila <sanvila@unex.es> 

2000/4/23
	+ modified to use gettext (configure option --enable-nls).  This uses
	  gettext 0.10.35, which must be previously installed.  (It can also
	  use an included intl library, but I consider that to be a waste of
	  disk space).
	+ remove code in checklist/radiobox, menubox that try to use
	  abbreviations for the OK/Cancel buttons since those conflict with the
	  check for abbreviations in list entries, which are more useful.
	+ moved padding of button labels out of string literals, into the
	  logic of dlg_draw_buttons().
	+ resync/update with configure macros CF_CURSES_LIBS, CF_FIND_LIBRARY,
	  CF_HEADER_PATH, CF_LIBRARY_PATH and CF_NCURSES_LIBS, as well as
	  mkdirs.sh and config.guess.

2000/2/22
	+ add --default-item option, for menubox to set the default selection
	  (fixes Debian #49796).
	+ add sample scripts for --nocancel and --fb options with inputbox.
	+ modify inputbox* sample scripts to show application errors, if any.
	+ add --nocancel option, and ignore --noitem, --fb, --fullbutton, to
	  make this compatible with whiptail scripts.  (whiptail does not
	  handle many dialog scripts however).
	+ modify checklist/radiobox to handle home, end, nextpage, prevpage
	  keys, as well as make the abbreviation search work for the whole
	  list, not only the current page.
	+ treat KEY_LL the same as KEY_END in checklist and textbox.
	+ add logic for KEY_BTAB.
	+ use new function dlg_draw_buttons() to better manage the layout of
	  yes/no/ok/cancel buttons.
	+ another pass of cleanup of dialog.c, makes it use a single table for
	  lookup of option names and help-message.  Eliminated numerous
	  adjustments to 'offset' variable.
	+ on initialization, check if standard input is from a terminal.  If
	  not, open /dev/tty (fixes Debian #57771)

2000/2/5
	+ implement inline editing in textbox.c search dialog.
	+ revise inputbox.c, allowing inline editing with arrow-keys.  removed
	  redundant logic in that module.
	+ correct a typo that prevented rc-file configuration from building.
	+ correct ifdef's to compile/run if the curses implementation does not
	  support color.

2000/1/23
	+ improve test-case for gauge.
	+ change gauge.c to show progress in reverse-video, add a check for
	  end-of-file in the loop for reading new messages.
	+ use curses whline() function to simplify print_arrows() logic in
	  checkbox.c and menubox.c
	+ use curses beep() function rather than hardcoded strings.
	+ correct several compiler warnings for gcc -pedantic (mismatch of
	  const, signed/unsigned).
	+ modify exiterr() to avoid possible expansion of '%'.
	+ change CF_MATH_LIB configure macro to allow specifying a particular
	  test-function.  For dialog, this should be sqrt().  The macro was
	  originally written for ncurses, which needs sin().  However, that is
	  a builtin function on the m68k port (reported by Roman Hodek
	  <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>, this fixes Debian #55553).

2000/1/18
	+ update manpage (Debian #25648).
	+ modify configure test for math library to avoid using a constant
	  parameter to the test function, lest gcc optimize the call away
	  (fixes Debian #55553).
	+ restructure help-message so actual problem is indicated.  The original
	  help-message is shown if no parameters are given, or if the --help
	  option is specified alone.
	+ suppress xterm's alternate screen mode by sending an exit_ca_mode
	  after initscr if the terminal looks like xterm, e.g., has key_mouse
	  defined, and has private-mode escapes in both enter_ca_mode and
	  exit_ca_mode (fixes Debian #55181).
	+ change yellow lettering on white to blue on white, since it offers
	  better contrast (fixes Debian #51196).
	+ use napms() rather than sleep().
	+ some cleanup/simplification of main program.  Indent'd dialog.c and
	  util.c
	+ eliminate several places where repeated options are treated as
	  an error, since they are really executed once anyway.

2000/1/15
	+ remove pre-autoconf Makefile
	+ remove sleep's from a few of the sample scripts, which left users
	  thinking that dialog was slow to complete an action.
	+ rewrote infobox sample script, using dialog's --sleep option and
	  a loop in the script.
	+ change 'ch' variable in tailbox.c to an integer, because it is
	  compared against EOF (fixes Debian #53157).
	+ corrected mandir variable in makefile.in (reported by Santiago Vila).
	+ small changes to sample scripts, from Debian: rename "guage" script
	  to "gauge", change path to copy of GPL used in textbox.
	+ add uninstall rule to makefile.in, fixed some dependencies so
	  "make install" works without first doing "make all".

1999/12/25
	+ use more portable scheme for tempfile generation in samples.
	+ add a configure script, prefer to not use the original Makefile
	  because it works only with GNU make.
	+ correct prototype of 'main()', which misused const.
	+ modify guage.c to use fgets() rather than gets().
	+ merge changes from Debian package maintainer
	  Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>:

	  1999/10/7
		+ add a password dialog box.
		+ implement "--defaultno" option to specify if the default for
		  the yes/no box is "No".
	  1999/3/10
		+ modify input.c to clear the input field to the right of the
		  given string (unclear:  this seems redundant, since the
		  dialog is drawn in a new window).
	  1998/12/8
		+ check for list_height less than one in checklist.c
	  1998/10/21
		+ use function wscrl() in preference to scroll() in checklist.c
		  and menubox.c (unclear: in ncurses, scroll() is a macro that
		  uses wscrl()).
		+ remove the "-I/usr/include/ncurses" option from Makefile
		  since Debian does not install ncurses' header files into
		  that directory.
	  1998/9/12
		+ simplify menubox.c using new functions print_arrows() and
		  print_items().
		+ add logic to handle KEY_NPAGE and KEY_PPAGE.
		+ change sample scripts to use Debian tempfile utility rather
		  than putting files into /tmp.
		+ change sample scripts to use 'dialog' from user's path rather
		  than in the parent directory as in the build directory.
		+ use the system copy of GPL rather than that in the build
		  directory as an example for the textbox script.

1999/11/27
	+ fix some gcc warnings about ambiguous use of "else"

1999/5/1

	+ cleaned up some of the redundant code with new functions:
		box_x_ordinate
		box_y_ordinate
		draw_title
		draw_bottom_box
		new_window

	+ modified msgbox.c and yesno.c to work with the KEY_RESIZE sigwinch
	  handling in ncurses 4.2

	+ corrected spelling of "gauge"

The relevant portions of the Debian change log for the original version
(dialog-0.9a-12) are abstracted here, omitting details of their packaging:

1998/5/24

	+ Replaced guage.c by the one in dialog 0.6z, which is known to work.
	  Fixes Bug #18284: unstable dialog.

1997/12/16

	+ dialog.c:  dialog_input_result printed with "%s" format.  This was
	  Bug #9913, fixed by Bill Mitchell, but the change was lost.
	+ Pristine source, .depend is not removed in clean target.  Instead, it
	  is made zero lenght (otherwise it would not work *without* fakeroot).
	+ Added '^U' support in input box (Bug #9915, patch by joey@debian.org).
	+ Wrote patch to fix core-dumping problem (Bug #13170).  Sven Rudolph
