This version of dialog was originally from a Debian snapshot.  I've done this
to it:

1999/12/25
	+ use more portable scheme for tempfile generation in samples.
	+ add a configure script, prefer to not use the original Makefile
	  because it works only with GNU make.
	+ correct prototype of 'main()', which misused const.
	+ modify guage.c to use fgets() rather than gets().
	+ merge changes from Debian package maintainer
	  Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>:

	  1999/10/7
		+ add a password dialog box.
		+ implement "--defaultno" option to specify if the default for
		  the yes/no box is "No".
	  1999/3/10
		+ modify input.c to clear the input field to the right of the
		  given string (unclear:  this seems redundant, since the
		  dialog is drawn in a new window).
	  1998/12/8
		+ check for list_height less than one in checklist.c
	  1998/10/21
		+ use function wscrl() in preference to scroll() in checklist.c
		  and menubox.c (unclear: in ncurses, scroll() is a macro that
		  uses wscrl()).
		+ remove the "-I/usr/include/ncurses" option from Makefile
		  since Debian does not install ncurses' header files into
		  that directory.
	  1998/9/12
		+ simplify menubox.c using new functions print_arrows() and
		  print_items().
		+ add logic to handle KEY_NPAGE and KEY_PPAGE.
		+ change sample scripts to use Debian tempfile utility rather
		  than putting files into /tmp.
		+ change sample scripts to use 'dialog' from user's path rather
		  than in the parent directory as in the build directory.
		+ use the system copy of GPL rather than that in the build
		  directory as an example for the textbox script.

1999/11/27
	+ fix some gcc warnings about ambiguous use of "else"

1999/5/1

	+ cleaned up some of the redundant code with new functions:
		box_x_ordinate
		box_y_ordinate
		draw_title
		draw_bottom_box
		new_window

	+ modified msgbox.c and yesno.c to work with the KEY_RESIZE sigwinch
	  handling in ncurses 4.2

	+ corrected spelling of "gauge"

The relevant portions of the Debian change log for the original version
(dialog-0.9a-12) are abstracted here, omitting details of their packaging:

1998/5/24

	+ Replaced guage.c by the one in dialog 0.6z, which is known to work.
	  Fixes Bug #18284: unstable dialog.

1997/12/16

	+ dialog.c:  dialog_input_result printed with "%s" format.  This was
	  Bug #9913, fixed by Bill Mitchell, but the change was lost.
	+ Pristine source, .depend is not removed in clean target.  Instead, it
	  is made zero lenght (otherwise it would not work *without* fakeroot).
	+ Added '^U' support in input box (Bug #9915, patch by joey@debian.org).
	+ Wrote patch to fix core-dumping problem (Bug #13170).  Sven Rudolph
