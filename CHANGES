-- T.Dickey <dickey@herndon4.his.com>

This version of dialog was originally from a Debian snapshot.  I've done this
to it:

2002/05/19
	+ add --no-collapse option to allow one to retain tabs and repeated
	  blanks in a message box (request by Roberto Simoni
	  <rs@menhir-informatica.com>).
	+ use DLG_EXIT_ESC constant rather than -1's in several places.  This
	  has the effect of changing some exit-with-error cases to denote that
	  the exit was because ESC was pressed (patch by Diego Alvarez
	  <diego.alvarez@entelchile.net>, forward by Santiago Vila).
	+ bump package version to 0.9b (with patch-date, as usual).
	+ add --exit-label option (request by Roberto Simoni
	  <rs@menhir-informatica.com>).
	+ updated de.pl to correct translation for "Cancel" (from Michael
	  Piefel <piefel@debian.org> fixes Debian #146402). 
	+ use definitions from autoconf macro AC_HEADER_TIME to ensure that
	  time() is properly prototyped.
	+ update pl.po, adding translation for "Help" (patch by Swiergot
	  <swiergot@hacking.pl>).
	+ update COPYING file, to reflect address change of FSF (reported by
	  Santiago Vila).
	+ update some configuration script macros:  CF_CHECK_CACHE,
	  CF_CURSES_CPPFLAGS, CF_HEADER_PATH and CF_MAKEFLAGS.
	+ correct misuse of "$with_XXX" variables in the configure script,
	  which prevented configuration against curses library as opposed to
	  ncurses.
	+ update config.guess, config.sub

2002/03/09 (a)
	+ modify geometry of samples/fselect scripts to allow them to run in
	  a 24x80 screen (report/patch by Santiago Vila).
	+ correct exit-code for menubox.c when Cancel is pressed.  This was
	  unintentionally altered when adding --help-button (reported by
	  Patrick J Volkerding)

2002/03/09
	+ add --timeout option, which forces the program to exit with an error
	  if no user response is given within the specified number of seconds
	  (request by <andrew@argoncorp.com>).
	+ modify calendar widget to allow day/month/year values to default to
	  the current date (request by <Ron.Perrella@bellsouth.com>).
	+ modify display of buttons in checklist.c and menubox.c to handle the
	  case where the button label is empty (Debian #134388).
	+ extended logic for ok/cancel/help to make this work with checklist
	  widget.
	+ revert pt_BT.po, apply changes to pt.po (report by Frederic L W
	  Meunier).
	> several changes from Stanislav Ievlev <inger@alt-linux.org>:
	+ add options --help-button and --help-label to make menubox display a
	  third button which can be used to return an exit code causing the
	  calling script to show extended help information.
	+ use home/end keys in input string-editing, e.g., inputbox.
	+ add option --max-input to limit length of string returned by inputbox
	  and other widgets which allow the user to edit a string.

2001/12/02
	+ add --ok-label and --cancel-label options (request by Kyle Sallee
	  <cromwell@kublai.com> independent of Xdialog). 
	+ correct usage message for --fselect option (reported by Patrick J
	  Volkerding).
	+ add samples/debian.rc, for comparison with slackware.rc
	+ corrected samples/slackware.rc, which was just the compiled-in
	  default values (patch by Patrick J Volkerding).
	+ modify search rule for rc-file to add a global rc file /etc/dialogrc
	  (patch by Patrick J Volkerding <volkerdi@slackware.com>).
	+ updated pt_BR.po with modified entries for fselect.c (Frederic L W
	  Meunier).
	+ add pl.po (Swiergot <swiergot@l02.ids.czest.pl>).

2001/11/11
	+ modify command-line parsing to allow a "--" argument to act as an
	  escape, so the next argument is not recognized as an option if it
	  begins with "--".  This is apparently one of popt's undocumented
	  features, upon which some Debian scripts depend (Debian #116642).
	+ add da.po (Morten Brix Pedersen <morten@wtf.dk>).
	+ add an install-strip rule to makefile, changing the normal install
	  rule to not strip the installed executable (based on discussion with
	  Santiago Vila).
	+ initialize my_output variable if user cannot open /dev/tty, e.g., if
	  su'd to another user (patch by Richard Braakman <dark@ssh.com> Debian
	  #117177).
	+ add configure option --with-ncursesw, to allow configure/build with
	  wide-character version of ncurses.

2001/10/14
	+ add option --ignore, to make dialog be ignore options that it does
	  not recognize.
	+ add option --trim, to trim literal newlines and repeated spaces from
	  text that will be displayed.  Add samples/msgbox2, which is the
	  same as msgbox1, but using --trim (cf: change for Debian #102942).
	+ minor correction to attributes for buttons.c to use active_attr on
	  the right-side of a button.
	+ add a sample dialog rc-file slackware.rc based on diffs from
		http://ftp1.sourceforge.net/pub/mirrors/slackware/slackware/source/a/hdsetup/
	  (discussion with Frederic L W Meunier).
	+ modify dialog.pl to avoid using a statically-named tempfile, allowing
	  multiple processes to use this script (patch by <euclid80@yahoo.com>,
	  Debian #110609). 
	+ correct fprintf() call in j_menu() function, i.e., "--menu" option,
	  which did not guard against expanding '%' embedded in the parameters
	  (Stavros Chatzistefanidis <sxatz@yahoo.com>).
	+ add et.po (Ivar Smolin <okul@trenet.ee>).
	+ update fr.po (Frederic L W Meunier).
	+ modify to allow scripts to alter the exit codes, mainly to
	  distinguish ESC and ERROR exits.  This is done by setting a shell
	  variable such as DIALOG_ESC to a new value (request by Petr Vandrovec
	  <vandrove@vc.cvut.cz>, Debian #99264)

2001/08/27
	+ use VPATH in makefile to support build with configure --srcdir, if
	  the make program supports that.  Note that samples/install/makefile
	  is not generated, due to awkward limitation of autoconf script
	  (reported by Frederic L W Meunier <0@pervalidus.net>).
	+ add po/pt_BR.po (Frederic L W Meunier <0@pervalidus.net>).
	+ correct sense of --enable/--disable shown in configure --help (report
	  by Frederic L W Meunier <0@pervalidus.net>).
	+ correct logic for --clear option, broken in 2000/07/02 (fixes Debian
	  #110254).

2001/08/11
	+ porting fixes to work on AIX: flush output to work around bug in
	  curses library, use ./killall in scripts to avoid conflict with
	  AIX program by that name.
	+ modify dlg_trim_string() to retain literal newlines if the string
	  does not contain "\\n" strings, and to retain leading blanks on the
	  resulting lines, for compatibility with older scripts (Debian
	  #102942).
	+ add charset specification to cs.po
	+ change dates in CHANGES to consistent format, add el.po for Greek
	  (patch by kromJx <kromJx@crosswinds.net>).
	+ eliminate static globals (bss, data) from modules rc, tailbox,
	  textbox using better parameter-passing convention, and const.
	+ cleanup temporary files in a few of the sample scripts.
	+ rewrote tailboxbg using select() rather than fork(), thereby
	  eliminating lock-files.  Only one process should be trying to display
	  on the screen at any given time.
	+ add error check to ensure that numeric parameters are really numbers.
	+ correct off-by-one in error messages reporting too-few or too-many
	  tokens for a given option (reported by George Mirchev).
	+ fix typo in manpage, "textboxbg" where "tailboxbg" was meant
	  (reported by George Mirchev <la@mail.techno-link.com>).
	+ use DLG_EXIT_xxx symbols consistently for all exit codes.
	+ updated es.po (patch by Santiago Vila).
	+ updates for some configure script macros from lynx:  CF_MAKEFLAGS,
	  CF_NCURSES_VERSION, CF_PROG_EXT.
	+ fixes to compile if <term.h> is included, e.g., when building with
	  AIX curses (report by Suzi Dowson <Suzi.Dowson@capgemini.co.uk>).

2001/05/27
	+ updated dialog.pot
	+ modify fselect.c to work with autosize, i.e., given height and width
	  zero (report by Martin Povolny).
	+ add a null-pointer check in justify_text(), needed by fselect.c
	+ add several more options which dialog can safely ignore, from
	  Xdialog 2.0.2
	+ refinements for configure macros checking for $CPPFLAGS, from lynx.
	+ update config.guess, config.sub to match autoconf 2.50
	> Martin Povolny <martin@solnet.cz>:
	+ add cs.po
	+ use nl_langinfo() to customize names for day-of-week, and month

2001/05/11
	> Vincent Stemen <dialog@AdvancedResearch.org>:
          Fixed dialog.c to not pass menu items through dlg_trim_string().
          Stripping extra spaces out of the menu items broke some of my
          scripts by altering the string that it compared to know which menu
          item was selected.  There should be no need to do justification on
          the menu items, which are always one line, anyway.

2001/04/29
	> Vincent Stemen <dialog@AdvancedResearch.org>:
	+ rewrote the text justification code to be able to have preformatted
	  text in the prompts with extra spaces like the older versions of
	  dialog.  If there are "\n" strings in the text, then extra spaces are
	  preserved.  Lines are always wrapped on word boundaries.
        + fixed --cr-wrap to break lines on '\n' (newline) characters and not
          add an extra line at the top and bottom of the text.  It now works
          as the manual says it should.
	+ it is no longer necessary to use "\n\" at the end of lines to escape
	  the '\n' character.  "\n" now works.  However, the old way, "\n\"
	  still works.
        + the fixes involved the following changes:
          - rewrote dlg_trim_string() to recognize preformatted text (know
            when not to strip extra spaces) and to pay attention to --cr-wrap.
          - rewrote justify_text() which now calls a new function in util.c,
            print_line(), to print each line and end it on a word boundary.
	  - modified real_auto_size() to call a new function
	    auto_size_preformated() to calculate the box size for preformatted
	    text.
          - removed skip_blanks() and skip_text() since they are not used by
            the new justify_text().
          - modified dialog.c to not call dlg_trim_string() on title strings
            so that titles retain their spaces.
        + modified the following demo files in the sample directory:
          - inputbox
	      changed all "\n\" strings to "\n" to demonstrate the extra
	      backslash is no longer needed.
          - inputbox1
              removed all the "\n\" strings from the end of the lines to
              properly demonstrate --cr-wrap.
          - msgbox1
	      this sample was using "--aspect 9 --cr-wrap".  Rewrote it to
	      properly demonstrate --aspect.  9 is already dialog's default
	      aspect ratio.  It now creates several dialogs in sequence,
	      demonstrating aspect ratios of 9, 12 and 6 and properly
	      demonstrates --cr-wrap.
        + made the following changes to the manual (dialog.1).
          - rewrote the description of --aspect to be more understandable.
          - rewrote the description of --cr-wrap to be more correct and more
            detailed.  It did say, "Otherwise, the text for each dialog will
            display on a single line.", which is not correct.  It wraps the
            text to fit in the box.
	> T.Dickey:
	+ use logic from menubox dialog in checklist to handle autosizing when
	  list height is given as zero (fixes problem reported by Eric Veltman
	  <eveltman@baan.nl>).
	+ modify checklist and menubox dialogs to check for too-wide data, and
	  truncate one or both of the name and text fields to fit (also
	  reported by Eric Veltman).
	+ corrected a few items from Vincent's patch:
	  - use C89-style comments rather than C++
	  - restore logic in justify_text() which checks for win==0, needed to
	    work with standard curses implementations other than ncurses.
	    The first call on justify_text() passes a null pointer as a flag
	    to indicate that checking should be done, but no screen updates.
	  - avoid modifying the buffer in decode_percent(), otherwise a message
	    containing a space or newline would be truncated at the whitespace.
	  - modify dlg_button_x_step() and dlg_button_layout() slightly to
	    work with altered print_autowrap(), etc.
	+ fixes to build/work with SunOS 4.x 5lib curses

2001/04/15
	+ fix a memory leak in mouse_region().
	+ simplify handling of optional parameters with new functions
	  optional_str() and optional_num().
	+ add calendar and timebox dialogs (compatible with Xdialog).
	+ correct typo in fallback definition for getparyx, and remove void
	  cast for mouse_open and mouse_close which prevented build with
	  Sun's Solaris compiler.
	+ rename --enable-lxdialog configure option to --enable-Xdialog
	+ modify CF_NCURSES_CPPFLAGS macro to match more variations of ncurses
	  header files.
	+ update config.guess, config.sub
	+ modify some configure script macros to avoid problems with buggy
	  autoconf 2.49c which breaks changequote().

2001/01/15
	+ small fix to revised real_auto_size() and justify_text() to avoid
	  adding origin to box-width, which broke samples/wheel.
	+ apply 1999/12/25 tempfile change to wheel and copismall samples.
	+ add sample script for tailboxbg.
	+ revised lock-file management to better ensure that locks are actually
	  created by the tailbox subprocess(es).
	+ correct hardcoded signal 15 in tailbox to SIGHUP to match
	  documentation.  Signal 15 is usually SIGTERM, which cannot be caught.
	+ correct off-by-one comparison of return-value for arg_rest() which
	  made
		dialog --gauge test 10 50
	  dump core because it expected a 4th parameter (fixes Debian #80641).
	+ resync config.sub, config.guess from
	  http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/config/ (which finally have
	  cases for OS/2 EMX), minor tweaks to related configure script macros.

2000/12/17
	+ restore treatment of predefined height/width in real_auto_size()
	  which was lost in 2000/12/12 rewrite (report by Raphael Halimi
	  <raphaelh@easynet.fr>).
	+ updates for configure script macros AM_PATH_PROG_WITH_TEST,
	  CF_CURSES_LIBS, CF_LIB_PREFIX, CF_PROG_EXT for $PATHSEP and $CFLAGS
	  fixes.

2000/12/13
	+ correct change for create_lock(), which resulted in an infinite loop
	  (patch by Chris Butler, <chrisb@debian.org>).

2000/12/12
	+ rewrote print_autowrap() and real_auto_size() to share common code
	  justify_text(), which now does text flow even when the string
	  contains newlines (fixes Debian #77199).
	+ improve create_lock() function using open() with O_EXCL rather than
	  fopen() (patch by Matt Kraai <kraai@debian.org> fixes Debian #78951).
	+ correct description of --fselect in man page (patch by Tomas Pospisek
	  <tpo@spin.ch> fixes Debian #77200).
	+ add --no-cancel as alias for --nocancel for compatibility with
	  Xdialog (report by Luis E Limon <luisl@abriasoft.com>).

2000/10/27
	+ some lint fixes using lclint (mostly void-casts, but some
	  sign-extension fixes e.g., for ctype.h macros, and loop in
	  dlg_char_to_button()).
	+ modified to build/run on OS/2 EMX with ncurses.
	+ minor changes to po/*.po (trim trailing blanks, provide explicit
	  translation for "OK"), to work with Solaris gettext.
	+ modified to allow this to build with archaic version (1.8.6)
	  of ncurses on FreeBSD 3.1 (does not run).
	+ update config.guess, config.sub from subversions.gnu.org

2000/10/17
	+ use new function sub_window() to check success/failure of calls to
	  subwin(), printing an error message if it fails (fixes Debian #74903).
	+ use combination of isatty/ttyname to look for workable tty device
	  on systems which have no /dev/tty, e.g., BeOS.

2000/10/08
	+ change exiterr() to use stdarg.h, make some messages easier to
	  understand.
	+ add dialog_clear()
	+ make samples/install/setup build.
	+ implemented mouse support for buttons, e.g., in yesno dialog using
	  ncurses (the gpm support no longer works, but is useful for reference)
	+ add a configure check for chtype.
	+ updates for configure script macros (CF_BUNDLED_INTL, CF_CURSES_LIBS,
	  CF_GCC_ATTRIBUTES, CF_GCC_WARNINGS, CF_INCLUDE_DIRS), and scripts
	  config.guess, config.sub
	+ cleanup of item-help change, integrate with checkbox and radiobox.
	+ add ja.po, from Hirofumi Takeda <takepin@turbolinux.co.jp>.
	> patch by Marco Mariani <marcom@sferacarta.com>
	+ add --item-help option, which makes menubox data interpreted as
	  3 columns rather than 2.  The third column is displayed on the
	  last line of the screen as a help/status message for the currently
	  selected item.
	+ add it.po, pt.po
	+ change TAG_KEY_HL to FALSE, making unselected items in checkbox
	  easier to read on Linux console.

2000/07/30
	+ change real_auto_size() to allow it to be used for dialogs that have
	  no prompt, e.g., fselect.  Also, rather than requiring both height
	  and width to be given as -1 for maximizing the dialog, allow either
	  alone.
	+ increase minimum height needed for autosized yesno dialog.
	+ add --version as an alias for --print-version.
	+ fix for build on Solaris without NLS (cannot redefine 'gettext()').
	+ add fselect dialog (compatible with Xdialog).
	+ add --enable-lxdialog configure option.
	+ use new configure macro CF_ARG_MSG_ENABLE to show progress with
	  enable/disable switches.

2000/07/02
	+ implement --stdout and --stderr options as in Xdialog.
	+ move logic that translates "\\n" into '\n' into main program to
	  simplify logic that formats text.
	+ make ifdef's for rc-file not specific to ncurses.
	+ correct logic making percent parameter of gauge optional.

2000/06/29
	+ add alternate test-script for gauge, adapted from Xdialog.
	+ modify guage to make optional a percentage which was read at the
	  beginning of the XXX-delimited message text, since clones of dialog
	  are written to assume this is text.  If the line is not a simple
	  integer, dialog will treat it as text.
	+ make the percent parameter of gauge optional, as in Xdialog.
	+ undo one use of CharOf() in guage.c, an error.
	+ fix configure macro AM_WITH_NLS to refrain from attempting to make a
	  symbolic link into/libintl.h if we are not using the bundled intl
	  directory from gettext (reported by Julian Coleman
	  <J.D.Coleman@newcastle.ac.uk>).
	+ add ru.po, from Michael Sobolev <mss@transas.com>
	+ updates for config.guess, config.sub from tin.
	+ updates for configure script macros:  CF_MATH_LIB (improperly nested
	  brackets/parenthesis) and CF_XOPEN_CURSES (make include of
	  <*curses.h> depend on configure tests).

2000/04/25
	+ repaint screen when a control/L is pressed.
	+ apply CharOf() macro to avoid sign-extension on calls to waddch(),
	  fixes a problem with accented characters (reported by Santiago Vila).
	+ add es.po, from Santiago Vila <sanvila@unex.es>

2000/04/23
	+ modified to use gettext (configure option --enable-nls).  This uses
	  gettext 0.10.35, which must be previously installed.  (It can also
	  use an included intl library, but I consider that to be a waste of
	  disk space).
	+ remove code in checklist/radiobox, menubox that try to use
	  abbreviations for the OK/Cancel buttons since those conflict with the
	  check for abbreviations in list entries, which are more useful.
	+ moved padding of button labels out of string literals, into the
	  logic of dlg_draw_buttons().
	+ resync/update with configure macros CF_CURSES_LIBS, CF_FIND_LIBRARY,
	  CF_HEADER_PATH, CF_LIBRARY_PATH and CF_NCURSES_LIBS, as well as
	  mkdirs.sh and config.guess.

2000/02/22
	+ add --default-item option, for menubox to set the default selection
	  (fixes Debian #49796).
	+ add sample scripts for --nocancel and --fb options with inputbox.
	+ modify inputbox* sample scripts to show application errors, if any.
	+ add --nocancel option, and ignore --noitem, --fb, --fullbutton, to
	  make this compatible with whiptail scripts.  (whiptail does not
	  handle many dialog scripts however).
	+ modify checklist/radiobox to handle home, end, nextpage, prevpage
	  keys, as well as make the abbreviation search work for the whole
	  list, not only the current page.
	+ treat KEY_LL the same as KEY_END in checklist and textbox.
	+ add logic for KEY_BTAB.
	+ use new function dlg_draw_buttons() to better manage the layout of
	  yes/no/ok/cancel buttons.
	+ another pass of cleanup of dialog.c, makes it use a single table for
	  lookup of option names and help-message.  Eliminated numerous
	  adjustments to 'offset' variable.
	+ on initialization, check if standard input is from a terminal.  If
	  not, open /dev/tty (fixes Debian #57771)

2000/02/05
	+ implement inline editing in textbox.c search dialog.
	+ revise inputbox.c, allowing inline editing with arrow-keys.  removed
	  redundant logic in that module.
	+ correct a typo that prevented rc-file configuration from building.
	+ correct ifdef's to compile/run if the curses implementation does not
	  support color.

2000/01/23
	+ improve test-case for gauge.
	+ change gauge.c to show progress in reverse-video, add a check for
	  end-of-file in the loop for reading new messages.
	+ use curses whline() function to simplify print_arrows() logic in
	  checkbox.c and menubox.c
	+ use curses beep() function rather than hardcoded strings.
	+ correct several compiler warnings for gcc -pedantic (mismatch of
	  const, signed/unsigned).
	+ modify exiterr() to avoid possible expansion of '%'.
	+ change CF_MATH_LIB configure macro to allow specifying a particular
	  test-function.  For dialog, this should be sqrt().  The macro was
	  originally written for ncurses, which needs sin().  However, that is
	  a builtin function on the m68k port (reported by Roman Hodek
	  <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>, this fixes Debian #55553).

2000/01/18
	+ update manpage (Debian #25648).
	+ modify configure test for math library to avoid using a constant
	  parameter to the test function, lest gcc optimize the call away
	  (fixes Debian #55553).
	+ restructure help-message so actual problem is indicated.  The original
	  help-message is shown if no parameters are given, or if the --help
	  option is specified alone.
	+ suppress xterm's alternate screen mode by sending an exit_ca_mode
	  after initscr if the terminal looks like xterm, e.g., has key_mouse
	  defined, and has private-mode escapes in both enter_ca_mode and
	  exit_ca_mode (fixes Debian #55181).
	+ change yellow lettering on white to blue on white, since it offers
	  better contrast (fixes Debian #51196).
	+ use napms() rather than sleep().
	+ some cleanup/simplification of main program.  Indent'd dialog.c and
	  util.c
	+ eliminate several places where repeated options are treated as
	  an error, since they are really executed once anyway.

2000/01/15
	+ remove pre-autoconf Makefile
	+ remove sleep's from a few of the sample scripts, which left users
	  thinking that dialog was slow to complete an action.
	+ rewrote infobox sample script, using dialog's --sleep option and
	  a loop in the script.
	+ change 'ch' variable in tailbox.c to an integer, because it is
	  compared against EOF (fixes Debian #53157).
	+ corrected mandir variable in makefile.in (reported by Santiago Vila).
	+ small changes to sample scripts, from Debian: rename "guage" script
	  to "gauge", change path to copy of GPL used in textbox.
	+ add uninstall rule to makefile.in, fixed some dependencies so
	  "make install" works without first doing "make all".

1999/12/25
	+ use more portable scheme for tempfile generation in samples.
	+ add a configure script, prefer to not use the original Makefile
	  because it works only with GNU make.
	+ correct prototype of 'main()', which misused const.
	+ modify guage.c to use fgets() rather than gets().
	+ merge changes from Debian package maintainer
	  Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>:

	  1999/10/07
		+ add a password dialog box.
		+ implement "--defaultno" option to specify if the default for
		  the yes/no box is "No".
	  1999/03/10
		+ modify input.c to clear the input field to the right of the
		  given string (unclear:  this seems redundant, since the
		  dialog is drawn in a new window).
	  1998/12/08
		+ check for list_height less than one in checklist.c
	  1998/10/21
		+ use function wscrl() in preference to scroll() in checklist.c
		  and menubox.c (unclear: in ncurses, scroll() is a macro that
		  uses wscrl()).
		+ remove the "-I/usr/include/ncurses" option from Makefile
		  since Debian does not install ncurses' header files into
		  that directory.
	  1998/09/12
		+ simplify menubox.c using new functions print_arrows() and
		  print_items().
		+ add logic to handle KEY_NPAGE and KEY_PPAGE.
		+ change sample scripts to use Debian tempfile utility rather
		  than putting files into /tmp.
		+ change sample scripts to use 'dialog' from user's path rather
		  than in the parent directory as in the build directory.
		+ use the system copy of GPL rather than that in the build
		  directory as an example for the textbox script.

1999/11/27
	+ fix some gcc warnings about ambiguous use of "else"

1999/05/01
	+ cleaned up some of the redundant code with new functions:
		box_x_ordinate
		box_y_ordinate
		draw_title
		draw_bottom_box
		new_window

	+ modified msgbox.c and yesno.c to work with the KEY_RESIZE sigwinch
	  handling in ncurses 4.2

	+ corrected spelling of "gauge"

The relevant portions of the Debian change log for the original version
(dialog-0.9a-12) are abstracted here, omitting details of their packaging:

1998/05/24

	+ Replaced guage.c by the one in dialog 0.6z, which is known to work.
	  Fixes Bug #18284: unstable dialog.

1997/12/16

	+ dialog.c:  dialog_input_result printed with "%s" format.  This was
	  Bug #9913, fixed by Bill Mitchell, but the change was lost.
	+ Pristine source, .depend is not removed in clean target.  Instead, it
	  is made zero lenght (otherwise it would not work *without* fakeroot).
	+ Added '^U' support in input box (Bug #9915, patch by joey@debian.org).
	+ Wrote patch to fix core-dumping problem (Bug #13170).  Sven Rudolph
	  <sr1@inf.tu-dresden.de>:
